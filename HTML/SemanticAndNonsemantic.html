    <h1>Semantic And Non Semantic Tags</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <b>Semantic HTML tags</b> are tags that clearly describe their meaning and
      purpose to both the browser and the developer. They make your HTML code
      more readable, structured, and SEO-friendly because search engines and
      screen readers understand the content better.
    </p>
    <h2>Examples of Semantic Tags:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>&lt;header&gt;</strong>: Represents the header section of a
        document or a section.
      </li>
      <li><strong>&lt;nav&gt;</strong>: Defines a set of navigation links.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>&lt;article&gt;</strong>: Represents a self-contained piece of
        content that could be distributed independently.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>&lt;section&gt;</strong>: Defines a section in a document, such
        as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>&lt;footer&gt;</strong>: Represents the footer section of a
        document or a section.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>&lt;aside&gt;</strong>: Represents content that is tangentially
        related to the content around it, like sidebars.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>Non-semantic HTML tags</b>, on the other hand, do not provide any
      information about the content they contain. They are primarily used for
      styling and layout purposes, without conveying any meaning about the
      content itself.
    </p>
    <h2>Examples of Non-Semantic Tags:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong>: A generic container for flow content that
        has no special meaning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>&lt;span&gt;</strong>: An inline container for phrasing content
        that has no special meaning.
      </li>
    </ul>
